Top 100 Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S.
Our research reveals the 100 most dangerous cities in America with 25,000 or more people, based on the number of violent crimes per 1,000 residents. Violent crimes include murder, rape, armed robbery, and aggravated assault. The data used for this research are the number of violent crimes reported to have occurred in each city, and the population of each city.

While Detroit, MI has been in the news as a possible comeback story it has also returned to this year’s list as the number one most dangerous city, moving up from the fifth spot last year.  Monroe, LA, a historic city incorporated in 1906, is getting increasingly safer.  Monroe gained attention in 2018 as being the number one most dangerous city.  This year the city moved down to the nineteenth spot with only 4 homicides, compared to 11 the prior year.

There are some newcomers to the list this year.  Scranton, PA, often referred to as “The Electric City”, and home to America’s favorite fictional paper company, Dunder Mifflin, made its debut on the most dangerous cities list at number 55.  Surprisingly, West Palm Beach, FL, a celebrity favorite and popular destination spot also landed on the list for the first time at number 81.
